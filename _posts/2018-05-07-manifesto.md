title: Manifesting Design, a Design Manifesto
---

I think design is, at its heart, something that's very intuitive to most people whether they realize it or not. Anyone who solves problems to any extent is employing some sort of thinking process that spans from ideation to refinement. At the very least, anyone who is selective at all about what products they use has some sense of what they consider "good" design. I also now believe, ever since I took this course on Human-Computer Interaction, that good design is something that can be well-defined, and can be practiced with diligence and intentionality; what this means is that everyone can benefit from design thinking, not just people who have the word "design" in their job title. Even the most tone-deaf of listeners can be inspired by a well-composed song, and can appreciate its beauty only more by learning to speak the language of music themselves.  The same is true for design.

These five values outline some of the most impactful and important takeaways I've gotten from studying HCI this past semester, and influence how I think about all sorts of problems around me now--not just software design.

## The Little Things Matter

Studying design surprised me at first with how high-level and abstract the processes were that designers use to ideate and refine their solutions. Knowing how expansive the scope of design is now, I'm more surprised in fact by how detailed and specific the corpus of knowledge can be for designers! Of course a lot of these practices are esoteric to specific sub-fields, like software or graphic design, but in general the best practices for visual, audial, and other modes of communication are well-established.  

One particularly fun topic for me was color theory, and how it specifically applied to user interfaces.

*From "Layout and Color on Small Screens" in* Designing for Small Screens *, p.147.*

Colors can of course be defined and organized very scientifically, but beyond that I had believed that use of color was entire a creative decision. In fact, there are so many human considerations and application-specific nuances to using color that I would never have thought to consider on my own. Especially for user interfaces, certain color combinations and usage principles need to always be honored, and these considerations can even change depending on the size or resolution of the screen.

Color is just one example of a low-level detail of a design that really matters to its overall success. Interface layouts and typography are some others.  Team Trendy Trash hasn't gotten to practice a lot of these since our actual software product is quite simple, but in other projects with more complex interfaces, I've seen nothing that deviates significantly from the guidelines we've read about.  We've done a lot of big-picture thinking this semester, but even in the early stages of a design prototype, such specific knowledge is crucial--even if only to prevent bad practices from being distracting! The takeaway is that **the little things always matter and can make or break a design**, even if the overall scope of the solution is broad.

## Design is a Science and Nothing Less

Because design is actually so well-defined and has many established and understood principles, that means we can evaluate designs not just subjectively but with quantifiable metrics and controlled processes.  The second point of this manifesto is that **design is a science**, not just an artform as many people tend to think of it (especially when imagining graphic and visual design). I really realized the truth about how rigorous the design process when we [reviewed and responded to a scholarly HCI paper](http://www.grchen.com/csci376/2018-04-23-res-paper/); I looked at ["The Design of Eco-Feedback Technology"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753629) by Jon Froehlich et al., published in the proceedings of CHI 2010. One conclusion of this study was that, especially in the field of eco-feedback systems like Trendy Trash, HCI researchers are great at producing human-centered designs that are comprehensive and thought-out (especially visually), and implementing them too.  Where they fell short was evaluating these in a behavioral psychology context, and determining the underlying human motivations and mechanisms at work (the behavioral psychologists were great at this, but their designs were apparently very lackluster).

We've been stressing rigorous design practices and standards all semester, but haven't gotten to implement much significant evaluation at the scale of our projects. Something I find important and would like to focus more on in the future during the design process is how we can incorporate scientific findings from behavioral psychology and other disciplines into the design ideation process, and then also evaluate specific designs in that context once designs have been implemented or tested.

## Iteration is Good for the Soul

Experimentation means running trials, and in the design context we can perhaps think of running trials as iteration. Practicing iteration is a lot like going to the dentist, or cleaning your bathroom--you have a strong aversion to doing it, even though you know how good it is for you.  The temptation to formulate one "perfect" idea and stick to it is so strong, I think for a lot of reasons. It's easy and fast. It lets you look at what you produced, dust off your hands, and say "All done!" It doesn't give you a chance to hear where you were wrong. Yet the most valuable features of our design would not have existed without having gone through several rounds of refinement and improvement.

Testing goes closely hand-in-hand with iterating, of course. There's often a giant chasm of cognitive dissonance between designer and user, in the most unexpected ways.  Our first paper prototype user test, for example, revealed that we hadn't thought about how we would even initially convey to a user that the display in our system was an interactive touch-screen. Things like this are easy to take for granted, especially after tunneling your vision into a specific design while working on it. **Iterating and testing constantly provides sets of fresh eyes on a solution**, and exposes what you think is a good idea to the people who would actually be the judge of if it is or not.

## Better Design for Some is Better Design for All

An important attitude shift regarding accessible design that I had while studying it this semester was that designing a product to accommodate as many people as possible isn't just a formality or a nicety.  We shouldn't think of accessible design as an afterthought to tackle after the main userbase has been sated; rather **accessible design benefits all users** and encourages you as a creator to think more stringently about how your design is used by all types of audiences.

One actionable takeaway I definitely want to implement in my own life is writing descriptive alt-text for any images I upload online, whether it's on Facebook, on my personal website, or on something for work. I had never thought about how much difference it can make to someone using a screen reader, but now that we talked about it it's quite obvious and also would be something relatively easy to do for normal web users like me.

## Please Design Responsibly

Ethics has been a surprisingly salient topic in my computer science studies, especially in AI and machine learning. Studying ethical computing from those perspectives is difficult though, as it's hard to align human values with mathematical constructs and processes at times. I think it makes a lot more sense to think about ethics from an HCI perspective, about usability and human-centered design. 

Consider [this article on Amazon's "last mile" workers from our readings](https://gizmodo.com/amazons-last-mile-1820451224) for example. We could think about how Amazon could make its sorting and shipping systems more efficient through some smart-data-learning-AI-cloud-technology solution of sorts.  But thinking about efficiency-maximization at the expense of the human individual is what led to the situation in the first place! Instead, thinking about delivery drivers as *users* might give us better insights as to how the system can be designed to support them in their jobs.  

A lot of discrimination in data and machine learning comes from biases in the data collection phase.  Surprisingly, there are ways to [mitigate this algorithmically at data processing time](http://cs.williams.edu/~andrea/cs374/Articles/feldman.pdf). What might make more sense, however, is how we can rethink the systems that lead to harmful datasets being constructed to be more fair.  Designers are perhaps the best people in the product development process to think about ethics and social responsibility, so its important that people who engage in design have a strong grasp on what problems are important and how they can be addressed before it's too late.

## Conclusion
