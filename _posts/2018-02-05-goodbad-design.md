## Bad Design

Let's start with the bad news. I've always been irked by a few bad design quirks around campus, but one of my favorites is definitely a recurrent trend of "things not fitting into the trash cans they're designed for". Here's the standard diningware return receptacle found in various buildings around Williams, and a plate from Mission dining hall (one of three dining locations on campus):

Another hilarous example that was quite popular on my social media--a common "plastic/metal" recycling container, obviously intended for bottles and cans, and a plastic drink cup from Goodrich coffee bar:

I like to think about what motivations went into creating these oddly shaped openings in these particular trash bins. The first dish return bin is a little baffling, since the only square dishware used on is a clamshell takeout container (which, by the way, also doesn't fit). If we removed the strangely shaped lid to the bin, it would allow for any sized object that fits to enter! However, we probably don't want people stuffing objects that barely fit inside a trash bin.  Some kind of lid or at least a cover of some sort furthermore provides a barrier against any unsightly innards or wafting odors, and even just a thin lip or collar helps by holding liner bags in place.

If you decide to put a lid on a bin designed for receiving such a specific set of materials (or are the one in charge of purchasing such bins), it's not a tough job to just make sure everything you expect to go in the bin actually fits through the opening.  There are maybe only a couple dozen different possible ojects that students will ever return to these containers.

The thing is, containers have already been designed to hell in almost every conceivable fashion, and whoever put these bins in place probably wasn't making a conscious *design* decision, but rather a *consumer* decision. Finding a working trash bin is no difficult task, but it's clear that someone prioritized some sort of strange aesthetic in order for these bins to end up everywhere on campus.

The second bin is a little more understandable, but still an example of overdesign.  The hole in this lid clearly is supposed to accept bottles and cans and other cylindrical containers, but 1. it doesn't seem to do so successfully and 2. I've seen student stuff all sorts of plastic and metal disposables into that small circular hole anyway.

Half the time, a user of one of these bins just ends up opening the lid themselves. These bins are a great example of how what's essentially just a container--possibly the most designed object in history--can still be messed up today.

### Honorable mentions

Here are some other notable "bad designs" I considered for this project.

Lassell Gymnasium's walls are always quartered off during the winter out of a danger of falling ice.  It's not like they knew the building would end up in a locale with harsh, icy winters or anything!

Sawyer Library flaunts its high-tech classroom spaces, but I fumbles around in darkness for a good half-minute before determining that this was what they considered a suitable lightswitch for the modern age.

Sawyer offers up these classroom spaces to students to work in freely when they're not reserved for academic use; if only there was a way to signal to students that the room is open!  Sadly, these doors are closed and in the way, and nothing in the world apparently is capable of holding them open.

Oh well, we'll just throw up a sign.
