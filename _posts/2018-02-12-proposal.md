## A Trashy College

Institutions like Williams College care a lot about the garbage they produce--namely, what kind of garbage it is and how much of it gets accumulated.

You can see this at each of our three dining halls, especially Lee's Snack Bar and Whitman's Grill which are located in Paresky Student Center (which also houses the campus mailroom). Here, hordes of waste--trash, recyclables, and compostables--are generated on a daily basis. As you can see, dining services have made it clear that waste of different types should be separated. The color-coded rings at dining hall dish returns and three-stooges trash can trios all around campus are consistent between buildings, and are a great signaler and on-campus convention that encourages students to separate their recyclables and compostables from landfill trash. Every type of disposable you can obtain from a dining hall is even exhibited on wall-mounted posters to show what items count as what kinds of waste. 

In the first picture above, you can see that the green holes for compost are much larger than the red hole for trash: this was a recent development. Last year, they were all the same size, but the larger compost opening now accepts biodegradable takeout boxes and other large items, and also just act as a great unconsious visual cue that encourages compost rather than waste. If nothing else, your mind just naturally goes for the bigger hole by default since it looks like less effort to get something into it!

## Feedback for the Food Trash

In many ways, the design of this system fulfills the goal of encouraging resource/waste mindfulness among students really well. I found that the one thing missing, however, was feedback. Students for sure know where to deposit what kinds of garbage now, but at the end of the day the impact of deciding to compost my biodegradable plastic spoon instead of throwing it away is lost to me before the layers and layers of indirection between that immediate human action and the real environmental change it may effect. 

What's needed is a real-time, encouraging feedback system that signals to students what trends or progress exist between the trash can they're about to use and greater measures of environmental impact. Making the solution interactive and real-time is crucial; we could just throw up statistics on a screen that represent the whole campus's waste generation habits, but that kind of information doesn't carry any immediate weight or consequence with it. Even if the actual displayed feedback is just an artificial or purely visual signal, any sort of interactive cue that responds at a micro-action level could change behaviors on the fly! Especially with today's technology, making a system like waste sorting responsive and interactive has great implementation potential.  


## Trashy Television

Just to show that it'd be perfectly plausible and agreeable with any administration to install such a display or system in a dining hall, here are some examples of screens that have been recently erected that...well, to be quite honest, aren't doing that much anyway. They just kinda sit there and scroll through vaguely relevant information, which is ironic since every student carries a similar but ten-times-better device in their pockets with them at all times anyway.

## A Trashy Implementation

The idea in my mind of how such a system could be implemented right now involves weight sensors (cheap, easy to program with) and video/audio feedback right at the dish return station at Lee's. I imagine a display where a student about to deposit their trash can see the daily accumulation of each waste type so far, and watch as their own addition causes an over-dramatized change in the graphic. Simple pleasant animations or sounds can reinforce good habits or discourage bad ones, and a student that might have been just a little too lazy to sort out that extra piece of compostable garbage might now give enough thought for them to make the right decision.

## It's Worked Before

As an example to conclude, the recently constructed Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives is a model building for sustainability and low environmental footprint on the Williams campus, and features some pretty advanced energy consumption monitoring technology. If you were to use the building's kitchen, you would find that displays mounted in the space respond in real time to your cooking activities. Kitchen appliances are some of the biggest electricity consumers in non-commercial buildings, so to encourage mindful usage a computer science thesis student designed a system to monitor electricity usage and relay that information in a palatable, intuitive way to occupants of the building. I'm inspired by this feedback/response system, and think a similar one could have great impact in our dining halls for waste sorting. Between 2,000+ students, three daily meals, and five dining locations, thousands and thousands of decisions get made every day about how one's waste should be handled, and each one is an opportunity for a well-designed solution to encourage better waste-handling behavior.
